## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.


For this project, I was interestested in using In-depth soccer statistics from Jash from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: Does an offensive player score more goals than a defensive player?What is the salary difference in the western world and in the eastern world?
Question 2: Do offensive or defensive players have a higher quotient of goals per xG?Are there more jobs opportunity in the western world than that in the eastern world?
Question 3: Who are the ten most efficient players of the seasons considered?

# File Descriptions

Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations

2014-2015.csv - 2019-2020.csv Original dataset in csv format which includes data for six seasons of the european soccer leagues.

# Results

The main results of the code can be found in my blog post available [here](https://fabianeckert.medium.com/how-expected-goals-helps-us-learn-about-the-efficiency-of-players-in-european-soccer-380d54b9ce0b).
